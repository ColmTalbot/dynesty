Changelog
=========

0.8.4 (2018-02-24)
------------------

* Added new slice sampling option (`'rslice'`).

* Changed internals to allow user to access quantities during dynamic batch
  allocation. Breaks some aspects of backwards compatibility with generators.

* Simplified parallelism options.

* Fixed a singular decomposition bug that occasionally appeared during runtime.

* Small plotting/utility improvements.

0.8.3 (2017-12-13)
------------------

* Fixed additional Python 2/3 compatibility bugs.

* Added the ability to pass user-specified custom print functions.

* Added importance reweighting.

* Small improvements to plotting utilities.

* Small changes to improve user outputs and basic functionality.

0.8.2 (2017-09-15)
------------------

* Fixed `map` bugs that broke compatibility between Python 2 and 3.

* Fixed a bug where the sampler could break during the first update from the
  unit cube when using a `pool`.

0.8.1 (2017-09-12)
------------------

* Introduced a function wrapper for `prior_transform` and `loglikelihood`
  functions to allow users to pass `args` and `kwargs`.

* Fixed a small bug that could cause bounding ellipsoids to fail.

* Introduced a stability fix to the default 
  `~dynesty.dynamicsampler.weight_function` when computing evidence-based
  weights.
