Python implementation of the multimodal nested sampling algorithm "multinest"

Currently, this is a work in progress. The goal:

1. A pure-python (numpy/scipy - based) implementation of the algorithm.
2. If necessary for performance, speed up with cython.

The goal is to keep this in a single python module that can be dropped into
any application.
