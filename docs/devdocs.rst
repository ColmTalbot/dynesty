Developers' Documentation
=========================

Running tests
-------------

Running tests requires the ``pytest`` package, available via pip or
conda. Tests are currently not installed with the package itself, thus
can only be run from the source repository. Execute ::

    ./runtests.py

Building docs
-------------

Documentation depends on ``sphinx``, ``sphinx_rtd_theme`` and the
development version of ``sphinx_gallery``.
